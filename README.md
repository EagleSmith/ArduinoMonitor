# Features features...

* Simultaneously plotting multiple signals, with show/hide functions for individual signals.

* An easy to navigate plot area, with zoom and pan functionality in an adjustable grid.

* Export  to .csv functionality to create graphs for reports or research papers.


# Still To do

* Add smoothing/derivative/filter functionality to the plotter, so you can more easily see what happens with the signal when you would add one of these functions in your sketch.

* Generate C code for the above functionality to paste into your sketches.

* Add a custom graph plotter, so you're able to compare say y=sin(x) with your input signal

* Make it easier to move around and zoom in and out, more concrete, look at 

* Add 3D functionality, to let the graphs pop off the screen!

* Windows 8 support? WPF is also the basis for Windows 8 apps, so it should be relatively easy to add touch support, pinch to zoom etc in an app kind-of way.
